# Model
- Models will be stored in Android's built-in SQLite system.
- Model storage will be orchestrated with an ORM system such as Hibernate.


### Model Style
All of our data can not be represented by database models â€” and in fact, we *do not* want to represent some of it in a database.
Devices can be relatively transient and storing them in a database locally can prove problematic while synching up.


### Model Types
Models will be written in several styles:
- Pure Database/ORM ~> Stored locally in the on-device database.
- Pure HTTP/RESTful ~> Retrieved from the REST API, cached in memory during app run.
- Hybrid ORM+REST ~> Updated from REST API, but cached to local database.


### What kind of data will be stored?

  - App ID

  - Other notification metadata


- Per-Application Settings

  - Notification setting


- Devices

  - "Friendly" name
  - Last seen time
